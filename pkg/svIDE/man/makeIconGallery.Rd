\title{ Create galleries of icons for SciViews-K and Komodo }

\description{
  The "pick icon" dialog box of Komodo uses icon galleries. SciViews-K redefines
  such galleries for easier access to the icons, and it supplements about 1800
  additional icons. The present function builds those galleries, based on a list
  of icons manually compiled.
