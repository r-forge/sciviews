== Changes in svIDE 0.9-47

* guiComplete now does not have a givetype argument any more. Extra information
  is now always returned. This follows changes made in the original Complete()
  function in svMisc that is called by guiComplete().
  

== Changes in svIDE 0.9-46

* the trXXX() functions for Tinn-R are eliminated (they are now in their own
  tinnr package).


== Changes in svIDE 0.9-45

* svIDE is no longer linker to Tinn-R (there is now a separate tinn-r package).
  The trXXX() functions are left here in case someone still uses them.


== Changes in svIDE 0.9-44

* Made compatible with R 2.6.x (was R 2.7.0 in previous version).


== Changes in svIDE 0.9-43

* trObjSearch() and trObjList() andre reworked in order to return results
  similar to the old functions of the same name in svIDE < 0.9-40.


== Changes in svIDE 0.9-42

* getKeywords() is simplified by using lsf.str().

* guiDDEInstall now uses .Tcl.args() instead of .Tcl.callback to install
  callback functions in Tcl (preventing for moving the function in another
  memory location)

* A change in argument names for guiCalltip() and guiComplete() prevented the
  DDE server to work properly for those two commands (Tinn-R). This bug is
  fixed (Tcl does not support names with dots, like max.width). Hence, the
  argument is changed to width. Same for only.args that becomes onlyargs.


== Changes in svIDE 0.9-41

* One bug corrected in trObjSearch(): incorrect output of the results in a
  character vector.

* trObjSearch() and trObjList() now return TRUE/FALSE invisibly.


== Changes in svIDE 0.9-40

This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (Tinn-R is also supported, but not SciViews-R Console any more).
