Version 0.9-41:
---------------
- One bug corrected in trObjSearch().

- trObjSearch() and trObjList() now return TRUE/FALSE invisibly.


Version 0.9-40:
---------------
This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (Tinn-R is also supported, but not SciViews-R Console any more).
