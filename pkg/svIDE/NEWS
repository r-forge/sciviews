== Changes in svIDE 0.9-42
* getKeywords() is simplified by using lsf.str().

* guiDDEInstall now uses .Tcl.args() instead of .Tcl.callback to install
  callback functions in Tcl (preventing for moving the function in another
  memory location)

* A change in argument names for guiCalltip() and guiComplete() prevented the
  DDE server to work properly for those two commands (Tinn-R). This bug is
  fixed (Tcl does not support names with dots, like max.width). Hence, the
  argument is changed to width. Same for only.args that becomes onlyargs.

== Changes in svIDE 0.9-41
* One bug corrected in trObjSearch(): incorrect output of the results in a
  character vector.

* trObjSearch() and trObjList() now return TRUE/FALSE invisibly.


== Changes in svIDE 0.9-40
This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (Tinn-R is also supported, but not SciViews-R Console any more).
