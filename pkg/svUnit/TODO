= svUnit To Do list

* Install SciViews-K Unit Komodo extension

* Mean to save and load vUnit objects; also automatically load concerned packages

* Output results in wiki format

* butler: benchmark and profiling => check it

* Split example test into smaller test functions

* Make a vignette (and perhaps a demo) for this package

* Translate this package

* In RUnit/share/R, there are checkCode.r and compareRUnitTestData.r. The former
  provides functions for test R code in R files, the latter does a comparison of
  timings in two test set runs, using a tolerance value. Worth checking and
  integrating later on!

* In RUnit: checkException() -> get silent argument value from
  getOption("RUnit.silent")

* In RUnit, make a CheckWarning() function

* In RUnit: one bug is reported on RUnit SourceForge area for RUnit 0.4.17.
  Follow this to make sure it is corrected (or work on a patch!)

	myfun <- function(a, b = 98, c = 99){
		cat("a = ", a, ", b = ", b, ", c = ", c, "\n")
	}
	myfun(1, c = 2)
	# So far so good. Now let's inspect myfun:

	library(RUnit)
	track <- tracker()
	track$init()
	inspect(myfun(1, c = 2), track = track)
	# Here, we see that myfun is calld with argument not matched by names!
