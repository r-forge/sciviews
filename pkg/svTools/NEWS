== Changes in svTools 0.9-1

* Several bugs eliminated in tryParse() and lintUsage().

* lintUsage() renamed lint() for simplicity.

* lint() added to support code linter for Komodo with new 'flat' or 'rjson'
  output format. The function takes R code as a character string, or the name of
  a file and it outputs a data.frame, text, or rjson object that contains the
  error messages.
