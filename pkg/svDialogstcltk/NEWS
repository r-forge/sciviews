== Changes in svDialogs 0.9-1

* xxxx.tcltkWidgets() is now rewritten as xxxx.tcltkGUI() to match convention
  used in svDialogs (nativeGUI).

* The message argument in dlgDir.tcltkGUI() is replaced by title to match
  change made in svDialogs 0.9-48.
  
* There are new dlgOpen.tcltkGUI() and dlgSave.tcltkGUI() functions.


== Changes in svDialogs 0.9-0

This is the first version on R-forge. It is a refactoring from the old svDialogs
function that are replaced there by native dialog boxes, as much as possible.
