= svDialogs..tcltk To Do list

* Most dialog boxes still need to be done!

* Reimplement dlgMessage.tcltkWidgets() using something else than tkmessageBox()
  which is ugly under Linux and buggy with Mac OS X.

* For the moment, dlgList.tcltkWidgets() just delegates to tk_select.list()...
  but we could build a nicer list selector (also look at old code from previous
  version).
