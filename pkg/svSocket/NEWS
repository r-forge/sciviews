svSocket News:
==============

Version 0.9-41:
---------------
- Correction of a bug preventing processSocket() to display error messages.
  Instead, I got: Error in ngettext(1, "Error: ", domain = "R") : 
      argument "msg2" is missing, with no default

Version 0.9-40:
---------------
This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (Tinn-R is also supported, but not SciViews-R Console any more).
