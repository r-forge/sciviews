== Changes in svGUI 0.9-50

* HTTP server now works correctly with incomplete commands (bug corrected).


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-49

* HTTP server code processing now uses parseText() of svMisc >= 0.9-60 instead
  of the deprecated Parse() function.


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-48

* koCmd() now should prepend <<<js>>> to the JavaScript code to get it evaluated
  in Komodo (starting with SciViews-K 0.9-18). Komodo now also accepts RJsonP
  strings, prepended with <<<rjson>>>. If there is no code prepended to the
  string send to Komodo, it is just printed in the local R console.
  A new 'type' argument specifies what kind of string we send to Komodo.

* The R http server is modified to work with either RJsonP calls, or with plain
  text exchange, as the SciViews socket server works. RJsonP objects returned
  use list() to create lists, but also structures or new S4 objects.


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-47

* A new series of function to communication with a SciViews GUI client like
  Komodo/SciViews-K by using the R http help server is added. It offers a
  tcltk-free alternative to the svSocket server.
  
* The package no longer starts the socket server implemented in svSocket and it
  does not import svSocket any more. As the HTTP server is an alternative, one
  could now choose to run SciViews communication through the HTTP server without
  using svSocket, and thus, without starting Tcl/Tk any more.
  

== Changes in svGUI 0.9-46

* Use of svTaskCallbackManager() of svSocket >= 0.9-48 to register task
  callback that are also executed after each R code send by socket clients.

* guiRefresh() now clears active items and MRU lists in Komodo for non-defined
  active data frames and lm objects.
  

== Changes in svGUI 0.9-45

* Added guiRefresh() and guiAutoRefresh() to refresh automatically the content
of the GUI (Komodo) object explorer and the lists of active objects


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-44

* Preparation for CRAN submission: polishing the package


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-43

* Made compatible with R 2.6.x (previous version was compatible with R 2.7.0).


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-42

* koCmd() is now more robust and do not issue a warning or an error if the
Komodo server is not available (but the error message is returned by the
function with a 'try-error' class, so that it can be processed by the caller)


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-41

* Correction of a bug in the first example of koCmd()

* guiInstall() now creates a hook to koCmd(): .koCmd() in TempEnv environment


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-40

This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (Tinn-R is also supported, but not SciViews-R Console any more).
