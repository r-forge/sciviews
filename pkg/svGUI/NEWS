== Changes in svGUI 0.9-42
* koCmd() is now more robust and do not issue a warning or an error if the
Komodo server is not available (but the error message is returned by the
function with a 'try-error' class, so that it can be processed by the caller)

== Changes in svGUI 0.9-41
* Correction of a bug in the first example of koCmd()
* guiInstall() now creates a hook to koCmd(): .koCmd() in TempEnv environment

== Changes in svGUI 0.9-40
This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (Tinn-R is also supported, but not SciViews-R Console any more).
