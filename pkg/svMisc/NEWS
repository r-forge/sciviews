== Changes in svMisc 0.9-29

* isHelp() now uses find.package() instead of the deprecated .find.package().


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-28

* The temporary environment that TempEnv() attaches to the search path is now
  called 'SciViews:TempEnv' instead of simply 'TempEnv' to avoid potential
  conflicts with other packages in CRAN.


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-67

* Added the fileEdit() function.

* Reworked argsTip() function to eliminate old code (for R < 2.10).

* parseText() reported an error instead of NA in the case last string is
  incomplete in R 2.15.


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-66

* Added function isJGR().

* Added batch processing function batch().


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-65

* Partial argument matching in completion(), progress() and rmTemp() code fixed.

* Call to .Internal(...) in captureAll() eliminated, but ned to call
  .signalSimpleWarning() that is not intended for external use anyway.
  
* Call to .Internal(dput(....)) in toRjson() eliminated.


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-64

* Added listToJson() for conversion of lists of character strings into correct
  JSON format.
  
* Added pkgManXXX() functions to run R code for the SciViews package manager.


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-63

* progress() used \8, that was treated as octal for R < 2.14. Changed to \b in
  order to correct this bug. Thanks Duncan Murdoch for pointing me on this.


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-62

* captureAll() now handles user interrupts and allows for traceback() afterwards
  and default value for split now changed to TRUE. The 'echo' argument allows
  for echoing expressions being evaluated, like in the usual console, but a
  mechanism allows to abbreviate very long expressions.

* parseText() is reworked internally and it uses the srcfile/srcref mechanism
  introduced in R recently. firstline, srcfilename and encoding arguments are
  added.

* Unit tests added (should run with both svUnit (advised) and RUnit).

* A bug in objList() is corrected: if the list of objects in the environment is
  cleared, e.g., by rm(list = ls()), the function returned as if nothing was
  changed with compare = TRUE. Now, an attribute "changed" is set to TRUE or
  FALSE to differentiate between "no changes" and "changes towards an empty
  environment".


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-61

* Better handling of non syntactically correct names in objList().


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-60

* A couple of functions are renamed: Parse() -> parseText(), clipsource() ->
  sourceClipboard(). These functions are declared deprecated, and will become
  defunct in final version 1.0-0 of the package.
  
* captureAll() now returns NA in case of incomplete line of code parsed by
  parseText(). It also detects if expr is a valid language expression or is
  NA.
  
* isMac() was not working correctly on Mac OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard
  (bug corrected).
  
* Sys.userdir() did not expanded tilde in recent R versions (corrected).

* Little change in def() arguments: length.out instead of length to use the same
  name as correcponding argument in rep(). Coercion to logical is now done using
  as.logical()... but the result may differ from previous implementations.
  
* For listTypes(), the convention has changed. Method/type is now separated by
  an underscore instead as with two dots (like in view_text.default).
  
* Sys.tempdir() and Sys.userdir() are deprecated in favor of the new more
  general functions systemFile() and systemDir().
  
* r() is deprecated in favor of pkg() (r is not informative enough and more
  susceptible to be used elsewere too).
  
* Args() is deprecated in favor of argsTip() and CallTip() is deprecated in
  favor of callTip() (further homogeneization of svMisc function names). The
  new argsTip() and callTip() functions can reflow the tip to a given width, and
  callTip() can also return a short description of the function as well as the
  list of available methods if the tip os asked for a generic function.
  
* Complete() and CompletePlus() are deprecated in favor of a unique completion()
  function. Code of both original functions has been fused and reworked.


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-59

* RJSON objects now use a customized list() function to build lists, but also
  structures and new S4 objects.
  
* captureAll() has now a 'split' argument that allows to output to the R
  console, while capturing output.
  
* Bug correction in captureAll(): call[[1L]] is not subsettable.


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-58

* Additions of functions toRjson() and evalRjson() and specification of the
  RJSON (R-JavaScript Object Notation), an object exchange format not unlike
  JSON, but richer and more adapted to represent most R objects.


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-57

* Small changes to objList() (now look at objects in their correct environment).

* A bug in descArgs() with R >= 2.10 did not allowed to gest arguments
  description for functions using the '...' argument. Thanks to Diego Zardetto
  for pointing this bug.
  

== Changes in svMisc 0.9-56

* Temporary code to disable index.search() in devel R 2.11 in isHelp() and
  descFun().


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-55

* Implement descArgs using the new help system (parse_Rd), this eliminates
  the need for the workaround of version 0.9-54


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-54

* Cosmetic changes in Rd files to make them compatible with R 2.11 (devel). A
  part of the example of CompletePlus() is eliminated because it raises an error.
  

== Changes in svMisc 0.9-53

* Complete() now sorts items alphabetically and does not return completions
  as factor type in the data frame any more.

* CallTip() does a better work to find current function, i.e., not only after
  the opening parentheses '('.
  
* Args() now do no place a space anymore between the name of a function and its
  arguments
  

== Changes in svMisc 0.9-52

* Complete() now manages cases where code is like "iris[", "iris[[", or where
  last parsed token is empty (in this case, it returns the list of objects
  loaded in .GlobalEnv).


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-51

* Complete() now includes additions from Complete2() and CompletePlus()


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-50

* CompletePlus removes the weird object names ( .__M__, ...) which were
  causing trouble

* CompletePlus handles completions like "a[m"


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-49

* Complete2() is a temporary new version of Complete()


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-48

* Parse() does not detect incomplete R code any more, fixed (PhG)


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-47

* objList(), print.objectList() and write.objList() reworked (PhG)


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-46

* Added objList(), print() method for 'objList' objects and write.objList() (KB)

* Localisation complete and French local file done


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-45

* Made backward compatible with R 2.6.0 (was R >= 2.7.0 in previous version)

* captureAll() is reworked by Kamil Barton (KB). Debugging code eliminated (data
  saved in .GlobalEnv for debugging)

* Error handler added to captureAll() - KB.


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-44

* CompletePlus() reworked to use man pages instead of .Rd files

* descFun() and descArgs() added


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-43

* CompletePlus() created to obtain information on the completion possibilities


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-42

* objList() did not place each item in a line when result is written in a file

* objXXX() functions did not always returned results invisibly. Solved.

* Args() is more robust against bad 'name' parameter because it now calls
argsAnywhere() within a try().


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-41

* objInfo() returns also estimated size of objects that are not functions.

* objSearch() is reworked to return a single string using 'sep' as separator
when sep is not NULL.


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-40

This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (Tinn-R is also supported, but not SciViews-R Console any more).
