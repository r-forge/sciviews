Version 0.9-41:
---------------
- objInfo() returns also estimated size of objects that are not functions.

- objSearch() is reworked to return a single string using 'sep' as separator
  when sep is not NULL.

Version 0.9-40:
---------------
This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (Tinn-R is also supported, but not SciViews-R Console any more).
