== Changes in svMisc 0.9-57

* A bug in descArgs() with R >= 2.10 did not allowed to gest arguments
  description for functions using the '...' argument. Thanks to Diego Zardetto
  for pointing this bug.
  

== Changes in svMisc 0.9-56

* Temporary code to disable index.search() in devel R 2.11 in isHelp() and
  descFun().


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-55

* Implement descArgs using the new help system (parse_Rd), this eliminates
  the need for the workaround of version 0.9-54


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-54

* Cosmetic changes in Rd files to make them compatible with R 2.11 (devel). A
  part of the example of CompletePlus() is eliminated because it raises an error.
  

== Changes in svMisc 0.9-53

* Complete() now sorts items alphabetically and does not return completions
  as factor type in the data frame any more.

* CallTip() does a better work to find current function, i.e., not only after
  the opening parentheses '('.
  
* Args() now do no place a space anymore between the name of a function and its
  arguments
  

== Changes in svMisc 0.9-52

* Complete() now manages cases where code is like "iris[", "iris[[", or where
  last parsed token is empty (in this case, it returns the list of objects
  loaded in .GlobalEnv).


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-51

* Complete() now includes additions from Complete2() and CompletePlus()


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-50

* CompletePlus removes the weird object names ( .__M__, ...) which were
  causing trouble

* CompletePlus handles completions like "a[m"


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-49

* Complete2() is a temporary new version of Complete()


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-48

* Parse() does not detect incomplete R code any more, fixed (PhG)


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-47

* objList(), print.objectList() and write.objList() reworked (PhG)


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-46

* Added objList(), print() method for 'objList' objects and write.objList() (KB)

* Localisation complete and French local file done


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-45

* Made backward compatible with R 2.6.0 (was R >= 2.7.0 in previous version)

* captureAll() is reworked by Kamil Barton (KB). Debugging code eliminated (data
  saved in .GlobalEnv for debugging)

* Error handler added to captureAll() - KB.


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-44

* CompletePlus() reworked to use man pages instead of .Rd files

* descFun() and descArgs() added


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-43

* CompletePlus() created to obtain information on the completion possibilities


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-42

* objList() did not place each item in a line when result is written in a file

* objXXX() functions did not always returned results invisibly. Solved.

* Args() is more robust against bad 'name' parameter because it now calls
argsAnywhere() within a try().


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-41

* objInfo() returns also estimated size of objects that are not functions.

* objSearch() is reworked to return a single string using 'sep' as separator
when sep is not NULL.


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-40

This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (Tinn-R is also supported, but not SciViews-R Console any more).
