== Changes in svMisc 0.9-53

* Complete() now sorts items alphabetically and does not return completions
  as factor type in the data frame any more.
  

== Changes in svMisc 0.9-52

* Complete() now manages cases where code is like "iris[", "iris[[", or where
  last parsed token is empty (in this case, it returns the list of objects
  loaded in .GlobalEnv).


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-51

* Complete() now includes additions from Complete2() and CompletePlus()


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-50

* CompletePlus removes the weird object names ( .__M__, ...) which were
  causing trouble

* CompletePlus handles completions like "a[m"

* Complete2() is a temporary new version of Complete()


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-48

== Changes in svMisc 0.9-45

* Made backward compatible with R 2.6.0 (was R >= 2.7.0 in previous version)

* CompletePlus() created to obtain information on the completion possibilities


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-42

* objList() did not place each item in a line when result is written in a file

* objXXX() functions did not always returned results invisibly. Solved.

when sep is not NULL.

This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (Tinn-R is also supported, but not SciViews-R Console any more).
