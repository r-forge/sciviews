* objList() did not place each item in a line when result is written in a file

* objXXX() functions did not always returned results invisibly. Solved.

* Args() is more robust against bad 'name' parameter because it now calls
  argsAnywhere() within a try().


== Changes in svMisc 0.9-41

* objInfo() returns also estimated size of objects that are not functions.

* objSearch() is reworked to return a single string using 'sep' as separator
  when sep is not NULL.

This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (Tinn-R is also supported, but not SciViews-R Console any more).
