= svKomodo News

== Changes in svKomodo 0.9-58

* The package was not loading correctly when not on .libPaths. Fixed.


== Changes in svKomodo 0.9-57

* svKomodo creates now at loading a .Last.sys() function in SciViews:TempEnv
  indicating to Komodo Edit that R has quit. This is required to update R menus
  there.
  
* The SciViews-K configuration file is not saved from here anymore (CRAN
  now does not accept packages that write files elsewhere than in R temp dir).
  This configuration file is now created by the SciViews-K Komodo plugin, in
  svStart.R.


== Changes in svKomodo 0.9-56

* NEWS file reworked to use the new Rd format.


== Changes in svKomodo 0.9-55

* On some machines, system("locate Komodo ...") fails. Added some more checking
  in this situation.
  
* In .onLoad(), slight reworking of the svPager() function to avoid calling
  .Internal(file.show(....)).


== Changes in svKomodo 0.9-54

* Startup code is changed... a part of the code in svStart.R in the SciViews-K
  plugin is now executed here!
  
* Save and load SciViews config in ~/.SciViewsConfig.RData file, so that it is
  possible to reconfigure R for SciViews just by reloading the present package.


== Changes in svKomodo 0.9-53

* koCmd() can now use either socket or file for communication with Komodo.


== Changes in svKomodo 0.9-52

* The package is created from svGUI 0.9-51 (functions that concern interaction
  with Komodo Edit/IDE). guiInstall(), guiUninstall(), guiRefresh() &
  guiAutoRefresh() are also renamed koXXX(), in order to better match their
  purpose (to communicate with Komodo Edit/IDE only), while the previous
  implementation was intended for more general purpose. Since, it was never
  used elsewhere, narrowing its scope allows to simplify the code greatly!
  
* The callback mechanism to run commands from a client is now moved from
  svSocket package to here, so that it can also be used in the svHttp package.
  
* koRefresh() now look at the "changed" attribute of the object returned by
  objList(), and so, can make the difference between "no changes", and
  "changes, but the environment go no more objects".
  

Here is a transcript of svGUI before functions are moved to svKomodo:

== Changes in svGUI 0.9-51

* (nothing concerns Komodo's functions)


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-50

* (nothing concerns Komodo's functions)


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-49

* (nothing concerns Komodo's functions)


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-48

* koCmd() now should prepend <<<js>>> to the JavaScript code to get it evaluated
  in Komodo (starting with SciViews-K 0.9-18). Komodo now also accepts RJsonP
  strings, prepended with <<<rjson>>>. If there is no code prepended to the
  string send to Komodo, it is just printed in the local R console.
  A new 'type' argument specifies what kind of string we send to Komodo.


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-47

* (nothing concerns Komodo's functions)
  

== Changes in svGUI 0.9-46

* Use of svTaskCallbackManager() of svSocket >= 0.9-48 to register task
  callback that are also executed after each R code send by socket clients.

* guiRefresh() now clears active items and MRU lists in Komodo for non-defined
  active data frames and lm objects.
  

== Changes in svGUI 0.9-45

* Added guiRefresh() and guiAutoRefresh() to refresh automatically the content
of the GUI (Komodo) object explorer and the lists of active objects


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-44

* Preparation for CRAN submission: polishing the package


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-43

* Made compatible with R 2.6.x (previous version was compatible with R 2.7.0).


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-42

* koCmd() is now more robust and do not issue a warning or an error if the
Komodo server is not available (but the error message is returned by the
function with a 'try-error' class, so that it can be processed by the caller)


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-41

* Correction of a bug in the first example of koCmd()

* guiInstall() now creates a hook to koCmd(): .koCmd() in SciViews:TempEnv


== Changes in svGUI 0.9-40

This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (Tinn-R is also supported, but not SciViews-R Console any more).
