= svWidgets To Do list

* Make all these S3 objects and use methods add, addItem, del, delItem, ...

* Instead of Img object, use the key-value equivalent of gWidgets => define
  image resources in a graphical toolkit independent way.

* In the list of windows (.guiWin), include also RGui windows (console, graphs,
  etc...)

* Make a guiReadPackage() that reads images, icons, menus, toolbars & windows
  in row!

* Allow different styles for images depending on platform and style, and use
  them automatically.

* Internationalize this package


== Bugs

* in winMenuXXX (old stuff, recheck this with current R version):
  1) GPF when trying to allocate items to '$Graph1Main'
  2) 'Testit' & $ConsoleMain/Testit' are treated as different things!
