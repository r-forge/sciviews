  toolsXXX() and winXXX(), respectively.

* Reworked Author fiel in the DESCRIPTION file.

* Corrected a warning about argument partial matching in ToolRead() with
  R 2.15.0.

This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (Tinn-R is also supported, but not SciViews-R Console any more).
