== Changes in svDialogs 0.9-45

* Similar custom menus as winMenuXXX() functions are added and allow to add
  custom menus on the Mac (both R.app and terminal) and for R run on a
  Gnome desktop, providing the system is configured to manage such menus,
  see ?menuAdd.


== Changes in svDialogs 0.9-44

* The guiDlgXXX() functions are reworked into S3 methods and their interface
  changes. To avoid any confusion, they are renamed dlgXXX().

* dlgMessage() is reworked into native dialog box, but it looses a couple
  of options during the process (title, icon, parent). The previous code is now
  moved to svDialogs.tcltk.
  
* dlgInput() is reworked the same way, and it looses the 'parent' argument that
  was not implemented yet, anyway, and the 'title' argument that is now always
  "question" in order to match winDialogString() function for Windows.
  
* dlgList() is also refactored that way. Its interface is completely changed
  to better match the arguments of select.list() and to make it a direct
  replacement for that function.
  
* dlgDir() is completely rewritten, as well as, dlgOpen() and dlgSave().


== Changes in svDialogs 0.9-43

* tcltk R package is moved from depends to imports.


== Changes in svDialogs 0.9-42

* guiDlgFun() is adapted to the new help system provided in R 2.10.


== Changes in svDialogs 0.9-41

* When the path contained spaces, guiDlgOpen() and guiDlgSave() returned them in
  pieces.


== Changes in svDialogs 0.9-40

This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with SciViews-K and
Komodo Edit (SciViews-R Console not supported any more).
