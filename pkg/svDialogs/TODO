= svDialogs To Do list

* Most fixed dialog boxes still need to be done!

* Eliminate the dependency to tcltk, once all old code will be moved to
  svDialogs..tcltk.
  
* Translation into different languages.
  
* Rename .GUI .UI, make UI() and use it instead? object name is UI. setUI(),
  getUI(), startUI(), endUI(), and should they really be generic functions?
