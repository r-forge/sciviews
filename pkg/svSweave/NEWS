== Changes in svSweave 0.9-4

* Added a dependence to the ascii package to support Asciidoc Sweave documents.

* Asciidoc 8.6-7 is installed with the package but it will only work if
  Python >= 2.4 is installed. Asciidoc is distributed under a GPL-2 license,
  like the package.
  
* RasciidocToRnw() and RasciidocConvert() added to convert SciViews R scripts
  embedding Sweave data into Asciidoc .Rnw files and to Html, respectively.
  RasciidocThemes() lists available HTML themes provided with this package.
  
* svBuild() is a convenient function to automatically compile any SciViews-R
  script into the final document.


== Changes in svSweave 0.9-3

* Added functions tangleLyxRnw() and weaveLyxRnw() to be called directly from
  LyX using R -e svSweave::weaveLyxRnw("$$i")


== Changes in svSweave 0.9-2

* Added a svSweave-package help page.


== Changes in svSweave 0.9-1

* The LaTeX command for our chunks is renamed from \Rchunk{} to \rchunk{}.


== Changes in svSweave 0.9-0
