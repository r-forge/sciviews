== Changes in svSweave 0.9-8

* weaveLyxRnw(), knitLyxRnw(), tangleLyxRnw() and purlLyxRnw() now have a
  new argument logFile, indicating which log file to use.
  
* cleanLyxRnw() now detects if the SciViews Knitr LyX module is used, and it
  automatically switches to knitr to knit or purl the document in weaveLyxRnw()
  and tangleLyxRnw().


== Changes in svSweave 0.9-7

* All Asciidoc-related items are now moved to svDoc package.

* Weaving and tangling are now done with options(warn = 1) for immediate issue
  of warnings.


== Changes in svSweave 0.9-6

* Slight reworking of the Asciidoc-related function RdocXXX(). svBuild() is
  renamed makeRdoc() to be more explicit.

* Addition of header() function that creates an Asciidoc header.

* Addition of dynamic R document features, using a customized shiny engine.

* Ten examples of dynamic documents added. They are adapted from shiny examples.examples


== Changes in svSweave 0.9-5

* Now knitr can also be used to weave your documents (knitLyxRnw/purlLyxRnw).

* Asciidoc updated to version 8.6-8.


== Changes in svSweave 0.9-4

* Added a dependence to the ascii package to support Asciidoc Sweave documents.

* Asciidoc 8.6-7 is installed with the package but it will only work if
  Python >= 2.4 is installed. Asciidoc is distributed under a GPL-2 license,
  like the package.
  
* RasciidocToRnw() and RasciidocConvert() added to convert SciViews R scripts
  embedding Sweave data into Asciidoc .Rnw files and to Html, respectively.
  RasciidocThemes() lists available HTML themes provided with this package.
  
* svBuild() is a convenient function to automatically compile any SciViews-R
  script into the final document.


== Changes in svSweave 0.9-3

* Added functions tangleLyxRnw() and weaveLyxRnw() to be called directly from
  LyX using R -e svSweave::weaveLyxRnw("$$i")


== Changes in svSweave 0.9-2

* Added a svSweave-package help page.


== Changes in svSweave 0.9-1
