== Changes in svSweave 0.9-6

* Slight reworking of the Asciidoc-related function RdocXXX(). svBuild() is
  renamed makeRdoc() to be more explicit.

* Addition of Rdoc() function that creates an Asciidoc header.


== Changes in svSweave 0.9-5

* Now knitr can also be used to weave your documents (knitLyxRnw/purlLyxRnw).

* Asciidoc updated to version 8.6-8.


== Changes in svSweave 0.9-4

* Added a dependence to the ascii package to support Asciidoc Sweave documents.

* Asciidoc 8.6-7 is installed with the package but it will only work if
  Python >= 2.4 is installed. Asciidoc is distributed under a GPL-2 license,
  like the package.
  
* RasciidocToRnw() and RasciidocConvert() added to convert SciViews R scripts
  embedding Sweave data into Asciidoc .Rnw files and to Html, respectively.
  RasciidocThemes() lists available HTML themes provided with this package.
  
* svBuild() is a convenient function to automatically compile any SciViews-R
  script into the final document.

  LyX using R -e svSweave::weaveLyxRnw("$$i")
