= jquery slider

This is essentially the same jquery slider as in the shiny R package,
except there is only one style available and the corresponding image
is embedded as data-uri in the CSS file. Also, font size is increased from 9px
to 12px for a better readability.

= jquery easytabs

A minimal tab panel, from http://www.alfajango.com/blog/jquery-easytabs-plugin/
(dual license MIT and GPL). Minimal CSS style added.
