= svSweave - To do list

* Package svShiny code here + runExample()/runGist()

* Use more sensible values for toc: if missing and no author/revfield => no toc.

* A better management of theme: define one form html and one for slidy/slidy2.

* With the shiny jslider, I would like to be able to move left cursor and keep
  interval between left and right cursor constant... or, better, be able to drag
  the interval between the two cursors.
  
* Make a better default_shiny.R page that lists all existing pages on the server

* Rename xxx_shiny.R as xxx.Rdoc, simply?!

* Make interface for writing SciViews R documents in Komodo/SciViews-K.

* ascii() => view() + aware if ascii or latex and results=ascii/tex accordingly

* Clean up the latex export filter and make a LyX export filter

* Also allow to convert from LyX/LaTeX to Asciidoc

* Enable timer events on the page server and daemonize it on Windows
  (using Tcl loop)?
  
* A better logic for startPageServer() call, e.g., if the server does not run
  and a page is created
  
* In non interactive mode, detect when the last client exit and quit then
  also automatically, unles differently specified
  
* Allow for several author names

* Numbered items for figures, tables, equations and listings using Asciidoc
  replacement macros
  
* Save/reload pages installed on a server with R code

* Eliminate footer for slidy2 (interferes with dynamic documents)

* Allow to specify two themes: one for html, one for slidy/slidy2

* A better uiSideBySide() system

* Something similar to runExample() & runGist() in shiny

* Move the definition of `!` here from SciViews? Or put in svMisc?
