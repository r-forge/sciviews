Not really *named* regions, but an easy way to run portions of code quickly in SciViews-K (http://www.sciviews.org/SciViews-K):
* R -> Run marked block (or Ctrl+Shift+M) runs code between two bookmarks,
* R -> Run function (or Ctrl+Shift+F) runs the code of the whole current function (you may prefer R -> Source function in this particular case),
* R -> Run paragraph (or Ctrl+Shift+H) runs code in the current paragraph ("paragraphs" are consecutives lines or R code separated from other "paragraphs" by empty lines).
* Named regions of code (+ list "a la TODO list" with 'go to...' and 'run' + code folding on regions):
#REGION Init
library(whatever)
myprint<-function(...){print(...)}
#ENDREGION
