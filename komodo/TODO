= SciViews-K To Do

* Importation of SciViews-K-dev fork:
  + The sv.cmdout items + startR() + openHelp() + -RControl/_ProcessObserver in
    command.js
  + Rework completion according to SciViews-K-dev (see lang_r.py)
  + Rework UDL, but do keep modularity (R-mainex.udl + Rlex.udl), on the
    contrary to what was done in SciViews-K-dev (cf. we will need this for
    future use in Sweave documents!)
  + RHelWindow.xul => _getHomePage() slightly reworked
  + r.js/rconnection.js & components/svUtil.py/.idl: look what Kamil did and
    decide what to do with this.

Not really *named* regions, but an easy way to run portions of code quickly in SciViews-K (http://www.sciviews.org/SciViews-K):
* R -> Run marked block (or Ctrl+Shift+M) runs code between two bookmarks,
* R -> Run function (or Ctrl+Shift+F) runs the code of the whole current function (you may prefer R -> Source function in this particular case),
* R -> Run paragraph (or Ctrl+Shift+H) runs code in the current paragraph ("paragraphs" are consecutives lines or R code separated from other "paragraphs" by empty lines).
* Named regions of code (+ list "a la TODO list" with 'go to...' and 'run' + code folding on regions):
#REGION Init
library(whatever)
myprint<-function(...){print(...)}
#ENDREGION
