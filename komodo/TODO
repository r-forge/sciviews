= SciViews-K To Do

* Allow defining in which library to install R packages during configuration of
R.

* Start from the R server port configuration and make it a multi-session system.

* Web site: place SciViews-K in position 1 and indicate minimal and maximal
versions of R and Komodo we need.

* There is a bug with the abbrev expansion that prevents correct detection of
abbrev when the file is not saved or saved with a different extension than .R

* Files with .R extension are recognized as REBOL files!

* Pager currently display the file in a buffer and does not use title or
delete.file (file not deleted!). Try using a web browser instead, with
correct title and look for a method to allow deleting the file

* Object explorer: refresh content, tooltip, menu, changer fonction refresh

* svIO and svViews in relation to objects explorer

* sv.r.source("all") is buggy + add in menus/toolbars

* A more convenient Help page + rework R Help/R Help Search (external)

* Add R language entry in Help menu

* GUI for vignettes and demos

* doBraceMatch()

* Tidy R code tool

* Use JSON to transport objects between R and Komodo

* Avoid restarting a second time when the toolbox is installed + extract dir box

* R does not find Komodo (on Windows, and Linux) + way to reactivate Komodo window

* Problem installing a .xpi file from R in Windows

* setwd() with GUI, allow choosing starting dir for R kernels started from Komodo

* Configuration of R when started from .RData files.

* R reference cards

* R completion

* All the Tinn-R function that are still missing

* Make a Tinn-R GUI with simili-Tinn-R menus

* Make ESS functions + the ESS GUI

* Make Rd syntax highlighting; sweave later on

* R Linter

* Projects in packages (developments and binaries) + SciViews-K Unit features

* Make the User's and Developer's manuals

* Update the web site
