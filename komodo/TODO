= SciViews-K To Do

* Resolve conflicting shortcuts and define shortcuts that can be used on all
platforms => difficult task!!!

* svRQuiet should be a string, not a boolean. Shouldn't we switch to svRArgs
which would contain more args than just --quiet???

* Allow defining in which library to install R packages during configuration of
R.

* Start from the R server port configuration and make it a multi-session system.

* There is a bug with the abbrev expansion that prevents correct detection of
abbrev when the file is not saved or saved with a different extension than .R

* svIO and svViews in relation to objects explorer

* Add R language entry in Help menu

* GUI for vignettes and demos

* doBraceMatch()

* Tidy R code tool

* Use JSON to transport objects between R and Komodo

* Configuration of R when started from .RData files.

* R reference cards

* All the Tinn-R function that are still missing

* Make Rd syntax highlighting; sweave later on

* R Linter

* Add SciViews-K Unit features to SciViews-K

* Make the User's and Developer's manuals

* Finish the package manager

* R -> Session directory => R Session manager + check / add session dir and previous dir

* Demos/Data/Vignettes in browser => wrong encoding

* Add a PDF plugin in browser

* A csv editor in Komodo + R object editor

* Packages -> install R packages/load R packages => do not select all by default!

* Packages -> Old R packages => no package names appear in the output

* Packages -> remove packages => wrong list

* Packages -> select R repositories/update packages => use Komodo dialog box

* Packages -> unload packages => do not allow unloading required packages

* Debugging, syntax error detection, variable inspection, set breakpoint

* Change detection and outlining of documents

* Source list for all opened files or files in project as well as current file

* List installed and loaded packages in object explorer

* Inspect/modify variable during debugging

* Conditional break point

* Search in manuals + integrate Komodo help

* Debug autocompletion features

* Bug: crash of Komodo on exit on Windows and Linux

* put svStart.R in SciViews package

* Rework method to gray out menus

Not really *named* regions, but an easy way to run portions of code quickly in SciViews-K (http://www.sciviews.org/SciViews-K):
* R -> Run marked block (or Ctrl+Shift+M) runs code between two bookmarks,
* R -> Run function (or Ctrl+Shift+F) runs the code of the whole current function (you may prefer R -> Source function in this particular case),
* R -> Run paragraph (or Ctrl+Shift+H) runs code in the current paragraph ("paragraphs" are consecutives lines or R code separated from other "paragraphs" by empty lines).
* Named regions of code (+ list "a la TODO list" with 'go to...' and 'run' + code folding on regions):
#REGION Init
library(whatever)
myprint<-function(...){print(...)}
#ENDREGION
