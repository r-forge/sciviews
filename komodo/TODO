= SciViews-K To Do

* Allow defining in which library to install R packages during configuration of
R.

* Start from the R server port configuration and make it a multi-session system.

* There is a bug with the abbrev expansion that prevents correct detection of
abbrev when the file is not saved or saved with a different extension than .R

* Pager currently display the file in a buffer and does not use title or
delete.file (file not deleted!). Try using a web browser instead, with
correct title and look for a method to allow deleting the file

* svIO and svViews in relation to objects explorer

* sv.r.source("all") is buggy + add in menus/toolbars

* A more convenient Help page + rework R Help/R Help Search (external)

* Add R language entry in Help menu

* GUI for vignettes and demos

* doBraceMatch()

* Tidy R code tool

* Use JSON to transport objects between R and Komodo

* Avoid restarting a second time when the toolbox is installed + extract dir box

* R does not find Komodo (on Windows, and Linux) + way to reactivate Komodo window

* Problem installing a .xpi file from R in Windows

* setwd() with GUI, allow choosing starting dir for R kernels started from Komodo

* Configuration of R when started from .RData files.

* R reference cards

* All the Tinn-R function that are still missing

* Make Rd syntax highlighting; sweave later on

* R Linter

* Projects in packages (developments and binaries) + SciViews-K Unit features

* Make the User's and Developer's manuals

* Update the web site

Not really *named* regions, but an easy way to run portions of code quickly in SciViews-K (http://www.sciviews.org/SciViews-K):
* R -> Run marked block (or Ctrl+Shift+M) runs code between two bookmarks,
* R -> Run function (or Ctrl+Shift+F) runs the code of the whole current function (you may prefer R -> Source function in this particular case),
* R -> Run paragraph (or Ctrl+Shift+H) runs code in the current paragraph ("paragraphs" are consecutives lines or R code separated from other "paragraphs" by empty lines).
* Named regions of code (+ list "a la TODO list" with 'go to...' and 'run' + code folding on regions):
#REGION Init
library(whatever)
myprint<-function(...){print(...)}
#ENDREGION
