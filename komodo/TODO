= SciViews-K To Do

* Allow defining in which library to install R packages during configuration of
R.

* There is a bug with the abbrev expansion that prevents correct detection of
abbrev when the file is not saved or saved with a different extension than .R

delete.file (file not deleted!). Try using a web browser instead, with
correct title and look for a method to allow deleting the file
